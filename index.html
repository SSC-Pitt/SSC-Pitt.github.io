At the Sustainable Social Computing lab at the University of Pittsburgh, we research the interplay of technology and society in terms of 
<p>How social computing systems can be studied, designed, and implemented to more effectively achieve the goals of their different stakeholders</p>
<p>What roles these technologies play within different communities and how individuals and communities are effected by them</p>
<p>How we can partner with communities and individuals who have been historically excluded from the design and implementation of information systems to create more equitable and just technology</p>

<p>You can view more details about our projects <a href='projects.html'>here</a>.</p>
