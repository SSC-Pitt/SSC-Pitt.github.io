    # Projects

    At the Sustainable Social Computing Lab, we combine modern quantitative techiques like data mining, AI, and computational modeling with qualitative ones like participatory design, inductive coding, and survey data to create powerful and value-sensitive solutions that deepen our understandings of technology and the people who make it part of their lives every day. See some of our active work below!

    <h3>Designing for Awareness</h3>
    <p class="info">This project explores solutions to the lack of situational awareness in mobile messaging. We aim to understand how we can leverage virtual assistants to            inform the availability of their users. At the same time, another focus of this project is to make the functions of virtual assistants open and understandable to their         users, especially when these technologies involve AI and Machine Learning. This project encompasses multiple research aspects, including user modeling, technology design,          user-centric privacy, human-agent interactions, and explainable AI.
