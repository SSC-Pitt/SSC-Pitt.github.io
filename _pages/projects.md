    # Projects

    At the Sustainable Social Computing Lab, we combine modern quantitative techiques like data mining, AI, and computational modeling with qualitative ones like participatory design, inductive coding, and survey data to create powerful and value-sensitive solutions that deepen our understandings of technology and the people who make it part of their lives every day. See some of our active work below!

    ## Understanding team communication through cooperative-competitive gaming

    ## Modeling user messaging availability via smartphone app

    ## Participatory design

    ## Community Science for Air Quality Monitoring in Pittsburgh

    Given its industrial past and present as a 'Steel City', Pittsburgh's air quality has a significant public health impact on its residents. We are working with community-based organizations and using citizen-science principles to deploy a network of low-cost air quality monitors to make environmental data more legible and accessible to communities. In collaboration with a local environmental non-profit organization, <a href = "https://upstreampgh.org/">UpstreamPgh</a>, we designed and deployed a ‘Social Sensor Network’ of <a href = "https://smartcitizen.me/">low-cost environmental sensors</a> in the Nine Mile Run Watershed in Pittsburgh, PA for a 3-month pilot project. A network of sensors automatically reporting air quality and other metrics was virtually connected to a closed social media platform (Slack), involving a group of tech-savvy participants with a strong interest in environmental issues. The project was designed to include automatic, active, interactive, and passive forms of engagement to give participants various avenues to contribute to data collection, exploration, and interpretation. We are currently working on expanding the network to other communities, and designing workshops to use the data collected to tell <i>data stories</i> connecting local issues to global issues.
