# Projects

At the Sustainable Social Computing Lab, we combine modern quantitative techiques like data mining, AI, and computational modeling with qualitative ones like participatory design, inductive coding, and survey data to create powerful and value-sensitive solutions that deepen our understandings of technology and the people who make it part of their lives every day. See some of our active work below!

## Understanding team communication through cooperative-competitive gaming

## Modeling user messaging availability via smartphone app

## Understanding parent/adolescent collaboration dynamics in co-creation of an online safety intervention

### Investigators

### Summary

"Co-creation" is any act of creativity undertaken by two or more people ([Sanders & Stappers, 2008](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15710880701875068)). In the world of human-computer interaction, a very common application of co-creation is that of participatory design, a process in which researchers and users work together over time to create systems. The process enables allows the final product to incorporate the expertise of researchers, who are often experts in a relevant subject, with that of users, who are experts in the perspective of a system user. Participatory design has been shown to lead to more equitable designs which enjoy more acceptance and are more effective in their purpose.
