    # Projects

    At the Sustainable Social Computing Lab, we combine modern quantitative techiques like data mining, AI, and computational modeling with qualitative ones like participatory design, inductive coding, and survey data to create powerful and value-sensitive solutions that deepen our understandings of technology and the people who make it part of their lives every day. See some of our active work below!

    ## Designing for Awareness
    This project explores solutions to the issue of lack of situational awareness in mobile messaging. We aim to understand how we can leverage virtual assistants to inform availability of their users. At the same time, another focus of this project is to make functions of virtual assistants open and understandable to their users especially when these technologies involve AI and Machine Learniing. This project encompasses multiple research aspects including user modeling, technology design, user-centric privacy, human-agent interactions and explainable AI.
